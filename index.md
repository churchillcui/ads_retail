# Overview

## Background and motivation

Black Friday has been a famous sales promotion holiday around the country for over 60 years. While many people enjoy shopping for highly-discounted goods in the store during such precious family time, most sales managers are under great pressure, worrying about sales performance during this period. Such pressure comes not only in Black Friday, but also at each sales promotion time around the year, including Super Bowl, Labor Day, Christmas, etc. Many questions wait to be answered for these anxious sales managers: What are key factors that affect retail sales? How do they affect retail sales? With the knowledge of those key factors, how to get prepared for the future? 

Meanwhile, the booming e-commerce are making sales managers of leading offline retailers feel even more challenged, as both policy and strategy become different in the online shopping. Working in the high competitional retail industry, they are also eager to understand what are the differences between e-commerce and traditional offline retails. To help these sales managers of large retailers, we perform our retail statistical analysis, trying to provide answers and recommendations to some questions they are most concerned about.

## Objective

As the weekly sales data we obtained are provided by Walmart, we sought to answer four primary questions for Walmart sales managers through this project.

* How social and economic factors affect retail sales?

* What are the key factors that affect retail sales?

* Can we develop a predictive algorithm integrating current features and sales information to predict retail sales in the near future? What form should that algorithm take?

* What are the differences between online and offline sales? Do they have different temporal patterns?

## Data

Dataset from multiple sources have been collected and combined for use in our analysis, including

* [Walmart weekly sales and store features data from Feb 5, 2010 to Oct 26, 2012](https://www.kaggle.com/c/walmart-recruiting-store-sales-forecasting/data)

* [US Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data from 1st quarter 2010 to 4th quarter 2012](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDP)

* [US total retail sales and e-commerce retail sales from 4th quarter 1999 to 3rd quarter 2019](https://www.census.gov/retail/index.html)
